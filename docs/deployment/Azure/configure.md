# Configuration: Azure Cluster

For more customized configuration, please refer to the [Configuration Section](../configuration/Readme.md) and [Azure doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/vm?view=azure-cli-latest). 

## Azure Cluster specific configuration

We have greatly simplified Azure Cluster Configuration. As a minimum, you will only need to create a config.yaml file under src/ClusterBootstrap, with the cluster name. 

### Cluster Name

Cluster name must be unique, and should be specified as:

```
cluster_name: <your cluster name>
```


### Authentication
If you are not building a cluster for Microsoft employee usage, you will also need to configure [Authentication](../authentication/Readme.md). 

### Additional configuration. 

You may provide/change the specification of the deployed Azure cluster by adding the following information on config.yaml file:

```
cluster_name: exitedtoad
#vm size: westus:Standard_DS1, westus2:Standard_DS1_v2
azure_cluster: 
  <your cluster name>:
    "infra_node_num": 1
    "worker_node_num": 2 
    "azure_location": "westus2"
    "infra_vm_size": "Standard_DS1_v2"
    "worker_vm_size": "Standard_NC6"
    "vm_image" : "Canonical:UbuntuServer:18.04-LTS:18.04.201907221"
datasource: MySQL
webuiport: 80
mysql_password: <your password>
cloud_config:
   default_admin_username: core
   dev_network:
     source_addresses_prefixes:
     # These are the dev box of the cluster, only the machine in the IP address below will have access to the cluster.
     - "<devbox IP>/32"
registry_credential:
  <docker image registry name 1>:
    username: <user name>
    password: <pass word>
``` 

* cluster_name: A name without underscore or numbers (purely consisting of lower case letters) is recommended.

* infra_node_num: Should be odd (1, 3 or 5), number of infrastructure node for the deployment. 3 infrastructure nodes tolerate 1 failure, and 5 infrastructure nodes tolerate 2 failures. However, more infrastructure nodes (and more failure tolerance) will reduce performance of the node. 

* worker_node_num: Number of worker node used for deployment. 

* vm_image: Used to fix the image version if the changing LTS is breaking the consistency of the deployment.

* azure_location: 

Please use the following to find all available azure locations. 
```
az account list-locations
```

* infra_vm_size, worker_vm_size: infrastructure and worker VM size. 

Usually, a CPU VM will be used for infra_vm_size, and a GPU VM will be used for worker_vm_size. Please use the following to find all available Azure VM size. 
```
az vm list-sizes --location westus2
```

* Configure MySql as follows:

```
datasource: MySQL
mysql_password: <<mysql_password>>
```

* registry_credential: defines your access to certain dockers. A docker image name consists of three parts - registry name, image name, and image tag. If your job needs a certain private docker, then use 0. the registry name of that docker, 1. your user name and 2. your password to specify your access to it.
