# Configuration: Azure Cluster

For more customized configuration, please refer to the [Configuration Section](../configuration/Readme.md) and [Azure doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/vm?view=azure-cli-latest). 

## Azure Cluster specific configuration

We have greatly simplified Azure Cluster Configuration. As a minimum, you will only need to create a config.yaml file under src/ClusterBootstrap, with the cluster name. 

### Cluster Name

Cluster name must be unique, and should be specified as:

```
cluster_name: <your cluster name>
```

### Authentication
If you are not building a cluster for Microsoft employee usage, you will also need to configure [Authentication](../authentication/Readme.md). 

### Additional configuration. 

You may provide/change the specification of the deployed Azure cluster by adding the following information on config.yaml file.
```
cluster_name: <your cluster name>

cloud-init: True
azure_cluster:
  # subscription: <your Azure subscription>
  # resource_group: <your resource group name. ${cluster_name}ResGrp if unspecified>

Each item in `cnf["azure_cluster"]["virtual_machines"]` means spec for a set of machines, the properties of which are explained as follows: 

* `role`: functional role (DLTS-wise) of the set of machines.
* `managed_disks`: storage setting of the set of machines.
* `kube_services`: kubernetes services to run on the machines.
* `availability_set`: optional availability set under which we create the machines.
* `number_of_instance`: number of machine instances with the current spec.
* `data_disk_mnt_path`: the path that all data disks are mounted to.
* `private_ip_address`: use to bind certain private IP to a machine. If this parameter is specified, number_of_instance should be 1.
* `fileshares`: mounting paths for NFS service. `nfs_local_path` on NFS machines are mounted to `remote_mount_path`, then soft-linked to `remote_link_path`. NFS service might fail. We use the soft-link trick because it guarantees that when NFS service fails, operations would also fail, and we could know. Before we fix it, attempted operations would fail, but no vital damage would be caused. To allow less user effort, we also support stem-leaves mode, where users specify "stem" of paths, (such as `nfs_local_path_root`), and probably `vc` if the NFS machine is for dedicated storage, then several sub paths under `leaves`, and then a joined path would be generated.
* `gpu_type`: specified for worker machines. Currently all workers in a cluster have the same type of GPU

Some other properties that worth mentioning:

* `cluster_name`: a name without underscore or numbers (purely consisting of lower case letters) is recommended.
* `azure_location`: azure location of the cluster.

Please use the following to find all available azure locations. 
```
az account list-locations
```

* `nfs_client_CIDR`: specifies a list of IP ranges that can access NFS servers. Private IPs are allowed.
* `cloud_config_nsg_rules`: specifies the Azure network security group rules, `dev_network` defines the IP ranges that have access (including ssh etc.) to the cluster, `nfs_share` defines IP ranges that can communicate with storage nodes, and `nfs_ssh` defines the IP ranges from where we can ssh to the storage nodes, and the IPs should be public IPs.
* `registry_credential`: defines access to private docker registries.
